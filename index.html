<h1>I Am Frustrated</h1>

			<span id='nr1'>I am so confused</span>
				<p> I am so confused on this assignment. This stuff does not come easy to me and i'm having a hell of a time understanding what I have to do. I have rewatched the videos over and over again but what I try here doesn't seem to work at all. I have been getting extremly frustrated but at the same time I don't want to give up because Coursera already took my money for the month so I might as well struggle to finish this course. No matter how hard it is to me. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum' target='blank' title='Source'>Source</a></p>
